# First Principles of Computer Vision

## 1. Overviw

Joseph Addison:

> Our sight is the most perfect and the most delightful of all our senses.

The goal of Computer Vision is to build machines that can see.

Since, deep learning is so popular these days, is it even worth learning the first principles of vision? Why not just train a neural network with tons of data to solve the task?

Sure, but there are several reason to not do that:

- A problem can be solved precisely and consicely using first principles.
- When a neural network doesn't perform well enough, first principles your only hope for understanding why.
- Neural networks give best results when you feed them tons and tons of data. This might be very tedious or even impractical in some cases. In addition to that, models based on first principles can be used to synthesize the data instead of collecting it.
- Last but not least, the most compelling reason to learn first principles of any field is curiosity.

## 2. What is Computer Vision?

Roughly 60% of your brain is, in one way or the other, involved in the process of visual perception.

Computer Vision is about making machines that can see.

But, if we ourselves can see then why bother making machines see?

Well, first, we would like to delegate some chores to machines so that we can free up our time to do more rewarding activities. For instance, cleaning your home or driving to work can be delegated to machines.

Second, our vision system tends to be more qualitative than quantitative.

Lastly, advancements in technology have lead the vision systems to surpasss the capabilities of human vision.

### Image

Image is simply an array of _pixels_. Pixel is short for picture element. Each pixel in the image records information about corresponding point in the scene.
